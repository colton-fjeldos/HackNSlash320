# HackNSlash320
A 2D Sidescroller, Metroidvania, Looter-slasher
Hi Everyone!

Hack N Slash is currently a placeholder project name, we'd have to work on the story and themes of the game as we continue.

Here's an invite link to our Trello board: https://trello.com/invite/b/bkWkgyb3/ATTI914bb663b6c0eeb2f175fb43486670f80025D301/project-hack-n-slash

Here's a current list of the features we're adding!

- Creating a simple player controlled character
- Creating a camera controller script that follows the player
- A static, physical, simple stage!
- Create a pause menu with volume slider, that can be accessed by pressing a button on the keyboard/or screen
- Put the royalty free music into the game somehow, so that it runs
- After music is added to the game, make volume slider actually control volume level
- Save player progress.
